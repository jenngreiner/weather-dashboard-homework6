## User Story
As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

## Description 
Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that provides basic setup and usage instructions. You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## Usage
Open the [Work Day Scheduler](https://jenngreiner.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler-homework5/) in your browser. The current date and time is displayed at the top of the screen. Click on a text area for any given hour and enter a task, then click 'Save' for that hour slot. The color of the time lock will change as the day proceeds; past hours will be grey, the current hour will be red, and future hours will be green. 

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the work day scheduler's appearance and functionality:
